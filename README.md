### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?
    The biggest thing that caused me alot of my problems was my lack of dynamic rendering. Basically since  I did my grid items in HTML, I had alot of trouble with alot of my program.
    Espically since my Javascript wasnt working at all because of a small erorr I had at first, that made it not worked. To me, I guess the biggest confusion was because of the lack
    of visual instruction. I'm a visual learner and there was a lot of reading in the manuels and instructions. And it was really challenging for me since this was the first time
    I was working with alot of these products. While there was some wirefrimes, I really wanted more examples and maybe started code? Since I found my biggest roadblock (JavaScript)
    being because of a small error I made at the start with exporting and importing. I also felt really rushed since we started on Tuesday and not Monday. 
* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
    I would've asked more questions and ask for help with the started code. I loved the code review I had with my intern manager and wouldve had more of those as well. 
* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?
    I learned a lot of new things and being more open minded. Responding to feedback was important and also coming back from a challenge. Since I started my playlist in HTML but wanted
    to devolp my other features in Javasrcipt it was fun working with the two together.
### Open-source libraries used: 
- Add any links to open-source libraries used in your project.
### Shout out
    I would have to start out my intern manager. Without her, I would've never figured out my problem in JavaScript that was causing the code to not work. And because of her I felt like I did 
    more progress in that one day then that whole week. 

Give a shout out to somebody from your cohort that especially helped you during your project. This can be a fellow peer, instructor, TA, mentor, etc.
